Electricity Monitor project that showcases different technologies:
- WCF REST
- Silverlight (calling WCF REST)
- .Net Micro Framework

Projects are:
[ElectricityMonitor]
- Supposed to be the main site but not yet working
- Though it contains the WCF REST service that the sensor sends data to
- Contains the service that saves the sensor data and also provides sensor data
- Has the MDF file too
[ElectricitySerialFeed]
- Console application that accepts the Serial input from an XBee, sent by the sensor
- It sends the data to the WCF REST service
[GrapherLab]
- Silverlight application that calls the WCF REST service and displays the sensor data in line graphstyle
[GrapherLab.Web]
- Contains the GrapherLab silverlight application (test site)
[MonitorNode]
- .Net Micro Framework implementation of Trystan Lea's arduino energy monitor http://http://openenergymonitor.org/emon/

Enjoy :)
